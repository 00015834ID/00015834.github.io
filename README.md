The website I have chosen for coursework is KFC, and this is an actual website: https://kfc.com.uz/. My website includes 5 pages : home, branches, career, halal  and  available in english
and the Russian language.I chose to include a video on the front page along with a suggested table. I have used Javascript for a button to get back to the website`s main screen. One of the most popular options for website language selection is a language button. The available languages will appear to the user after they click this button. On the page, it will take you to the Telegram bot by clicking the career. On the branch page, there are six restaurants and brief information about location, opening hours, and phone number. I added animation to draw a user's attention to a specific area of the page and help them focus. This is frequently the result of clicking on a photo gallery, where the page darkens and draws your eye to the gallery. On the menu page, I did not write all foods; I only wrote burgers, twisters, lunchboxes, buckets, and drinks. Also, it was written with the price, name, and image of the food.
The last page Halal: There are certificates for all branches to indicate halal food. On the footer, I put the logo and a link to social media. As I said, it is available in the Russian language and there are all the same information in russian.
